      <strong>What can I learn from the Environmental Savings widget?</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>
      This widget shows how your investment in a SunPower solar system benefits
      the environment. We display estimated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
      avoided and additional relatable carbon factorsâ€”like miles not driven,
      pounds of garbage recycled, and mature trees grown.

        Can I see my estimated environmental savings for different date ranges?
      </h5>

      <p>
        You sure can! On the dashboard, you can see your environmental savings
        for the lifetime of your system. On the graphs page, you can see your
        estimated environmental savings for whatever time period you select with
        the date picker.

      <h5>How are my environmental savings calculated?</h5>
